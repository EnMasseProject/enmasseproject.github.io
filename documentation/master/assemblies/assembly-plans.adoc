[id='plans-{context}']
= Plans

Plans are used to configure quotas and control the resources consumed by a particular deployment. Plans are configured by the {ProductName} service operator and are selected when creating an address space and an address.

Resource definitions are a description of resources referenced by the plans, which can be configured with a template and parameters to be used when instantiating the template.

By default, {ProductName} comes with a set of plans and resource definitions that are
sufficient for most use cases.
