= Configuring address spaces and addresses using the REST API

{ProductName} provides an API that you can use to configure address spaces and their addresses. Clients can be configured to authenticate using
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC^]. 

All API URIs are namespaced, so all address spaces are within the scope of a particular
namespace. Addresses are within the scope of an address space. This means that:

* An address space in address space A might have the same name as an address in address space B.

* An address space in namespace A might have the same name as an address space in namespace B.
