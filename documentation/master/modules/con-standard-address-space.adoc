= Standard Address Space
The standard address space is the default address space in {ProductName}. It consists of an AMQP router network in combination with attachable storage units. The implementation of a storage unit is hidden from the client and the routers with a well-defined API. This address space type is appropriate when you have many connections and addresses. However, it has the following limitations: 

* No transaction support
* No message ordering
* No selectors on queues
* No message groups

Clients connect and send and receive messages in this address space using the AMQP or MQTT protocols. Note that MQTT does not support qos2 or retained messages.

// TODO This reflects the status quo, but how should multiple protocols actually be surfaced?
