= Address space plans

Address space plans specify the quota available to a given address space. By default, {ProductName} includes an unlimited quota plan for both the standard and brokered address spaces.

Plans are configured as `ConfigMaps`. Following is an example plan for the standard address space:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.link:service_admin/restrictive-plan.yaml[restrictive-plan.yaml]
----
include::../service_admin/restrictive-plan.yaml[]
----

The following fields are required:

* `metadata.name`
* `resources`
* `addressPlans`
* `addressSpaceType`

The other fields are used by the {ProductName} console UI. Note the annotation `defined-by`, which points to a resource definition describing the infrastructure that must be deployed when an address space using this plan is created.
