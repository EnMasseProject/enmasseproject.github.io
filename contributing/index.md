# Raising issues

Yes we have bugs as well!

We try to track all bugs, proposals, work items etc. using [github issues](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/issues). Raise a new github issue for any bugs or improvements. If you have a larger design proposal, make a fork, and submit a PR using the [proposal template](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/blob/master/documentation/design_docs/design/design-template.adoc).

# Hacking the source
